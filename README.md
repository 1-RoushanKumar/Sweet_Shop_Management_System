## ü§ñ My AI Usage

### AI Tools Used
I utilized multiple AI tools throughout the development process:
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Primary AI assistant for architecture decisions and code review
- **Gemini (Google)**: Frontend development and React component creation
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: Backend API design and troubleshooting

### How I Used AI

#### Backend Development with TDD
- **Claude & ChatGPT**: I used these tools extensively to implement Test-Driven Development practices. Specifically:
  - Asked Claude to help structure my JUnit test cases following the Red-Green-Refactor pattern
  - Used ChatGPT to generate comprehensive test scenarios for each API endpoint
  - Consulted Claude for best practices in writing meaningful unit tests and integration tests
  - Got assistance with mocking dependencies and setting up test data

####JWT Security Implementation
**Claude**: While I have good experience with JWT concepts and implementation, I used Claude to help with syntax and configuration details:
  - Quickly recall Spring Security configuration syntax and annotations
  - Get the correct JWT filter chain implementation structure
  - Remember proper CORS configuration syntax in Spring Boot
  - Verify role-based authorization annotations and security expressions

#### Frontend Development
- **Gemini**: Given my basic knowledge of React, I used Gemini extensively for frontend development:
  - Generated React component structures for user registration, login, and dashboard pages
  - Got help with Tailwind CSS styling and responsive design implementation
  - Received assistance with API integration using fetch/axios for backend communication
  - Used Gemini to create search and filter functionality components
  - Got guidance on React state management and component lifecycle methods

### Reflection on AI Impact

**Positive Impacts:**
1. **Accelerated Learning Curve**: AI tools significantly reduced the time needed to understand new technologies, especially Spring Security and React hooks
2. **TDD Implementation**: Without AI guidance, implementing proper TDD practices would have taken much longer. The tools helped me understand the Red-Green-Refactor cycle and write meaningful tests
3. **Code Quality**: AI suggestions helped me write cleaner, more maintainable code following best practices
4. **Problem Solving**: When stuck on specific implementation details, AI tools provided multiple approaches and explanations
5. **Frontend Development**: As someone with basic React knowledge, Gemini was instrumental in creating a polished, responsive frontend

**Challenges & Learnings:**
1. **Over-reliance Risk**: I had to be careful not to blindly copy AI-generated code without understanding it
2. **Verification Necessity**: AI suggestions weren't always perfect, requiring me to test and validate all recommendations
3. **Learning Balance**: While AI accelerated development, I ensured I understood the underlying concepts rather than just copying code

**Workflow Enhancement:**
The AI tools transformed my development workflow by:
- Reducing research time for unfamiliar technologies
- Providing instant feedback on code structure and best practices
- Helping debug complex issues faster
- Enabling me to focus more on business logic rather than syntax and configuration

**Overall Assessment:**
AI tools were invaluable for this project, especially given the requirement to use TDD principles and implement technologies I wasn't fully familiar with. They acted as knowledgeable pair programming partners, helping me deliver a more robust and well-tested application than I could have created alone in the same timeframe.
